# altshuller

Altshuller is a Python-based toolkit for inventive problem solving inspired by Genrikh Altshullerâ€™s TRIZ methodology, enabling users to apply systematic innovation principles to real-world challenges.

By encapsulating the core TRIZ concepts, it helps break down technical contradictions and fosters creative breakthroughs through a structured approach rather than trial-and-error experimentation.

Ideal for engineers, designers, and innovators, Altshuller streamlines the process of generating and evaluating inventive ideas across diverse industries.
